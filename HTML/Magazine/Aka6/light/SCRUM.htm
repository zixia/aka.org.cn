<H2><A name=Introduction>Introduction</A> </H2>
<P>In this paper we introduce a development process, SCRUM, that treats major 
  portions of systems development as a controlled black box. We relate this to 
  complexity theory to show why this approach increases flexibility and ability 
  to deal with complexity, and produces a system that is responsive to both initial 
  and additionally occurring requirements. </P>
<P>Numerous approaches to improving the systems development process have been 
  tried. Each has been touted as providing "significant productivity improvements." 
  None has. As Grady Booch noted, "We often call this condition the software crisis, 
  but frankly, a malady that has carried on this long must be called normal." 
</P>
<P>Concepts from industrial process control are applied to the field of systems 
  development in this paper. Industrial process control defines processes as either 
  "theoretical" (fully defined) or "empirical" (black box). When a black box process 
  is treated as a fully defined process, unpredictable results occur. A further 
  treatment of this is provided in Appendix 1. </P>
<P>A significant number of systems development processes are not completely defined, 
  but are treated as though they are. Unpredictability without control results. 
  The SCRUM approach treats these systems development processes as a controlled 
  black box. </P>
<P>The SCRUM approach is used at leading edge software companies with significant 
  success. We believe SCRUM may be appropriate for other software development 
  organizations to realize the expected benefits from Object Oriented techniques 
  and tools. </P>
<HR>
<H2><A name=Overview>Overview </A></H2>
<P>Our new approach to systems development is based on both defined and black 
  box process management. We call the approach the SCRUM methodology, after the 
  SCRUM in rugby -- a group responsible for picking up the ball and moving it 
  forward. </P>
<P>SCRUM is a management, enhancement and maintenance methodology for an existing 
  system. SCRUM will address new or re-engineered systems development efforts 
  at a later date. </P>
<P>Software product releases are planned based on the following variables : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Customer requirements - how the current system needs enhancing. 
  <LI>Time pressure - what time frame is required to gain a competitive advantage. 
  <LI>Competition - what is the competition up to, and what is required to best 
    them. 
  <LI>Quality - What is the required quality, given the above variables. 
  <LI>Vision - what changes are required at this stage to fulfill the system vision. 
  <LI>Resource - what staff and funding are available. </LI>
</UL>
<P>These variables form the initial plan for a software enhancement project. However, 
  these variables also change during the project. A successful development methodology 
  must take these variables and their evolutionary nature into account. </P>
<HR>
<H2><A name=Current_Development_Situation>Current Development Situation</A></H2>
<P>Systems are developed in a highly complicated environment. The complexity is 
  both within the development environment and the target environment. For example, 
  when the air traffic control system development was initiated, three-tier client 
  server systems and airline deregulation did not have to be considered. Yet, 
  these environmental and technical changes occurred during the project and had 
  to be taken into account within the system being built. Environmental variables 
  include: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Availability of skilled professionals - the newer the technology, tools, 
    methods, and domain, the smaller the pool of skilled professionals. 
  <LI>Stability of implementation technology - the newer the technology, the lower 
    the stability and the greater the need to balance the technology with other 
    technologies and manual procedures. 
  <LI>Stability and power of tools - the newer and more powerful the development 
    tool, the smaller the pool of skilled professionals and the more unstable 
    the tool functionality. 
  <LI>Effectiveness of methods - what modeling, testing, version control, and 
    design methods are going to be used, and how effective, efficient, and proven 
    are they. 
  <LI>Domain expertise - are skilled professionals available in the various domains, 
    including business and technology. 
  <LI>New features - what entirely new features are going to be added, and to 
    what degree will these fit with current functionality. 
  <LI>Methodology - does the overall approach to developing systems and using 
    the selected methods promote flexibility, or is this a rigid, detailed approach 
    that restricts flexibility. 
  <LI>Competition - what will the competition do during the project? What new 
    functionality will be announced or released. 
  <LI>Time/Funding - how much time is available initially and as the project progresses? 
    How much development funding is available. 
  <LI>Other variables - any other factors that must be responded to during the 
    project to ensure the success of the resulting, delivered system, such as 
    reorganizations. </LI>
</UL>
<P>The overall complexity is a function of these variables : </P>
<P><CITE>complexity = f(development environment variables + target environment 
  variables</CITE><I>)</I> </P>
<P>where these variables may and do change during the course of the project. </P>
<P>As the complexity of the project increases, the greater the need for controls, 
  particularly the ongoing assessment and response to risk. </P>
<P>Attempts to model this development process have encountered the following problems: 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Many of the development processes are uncontrolled. The inputs and outputs 
    are either unknown or loosely defined, the transformation process lacks necessary 
    precision, and quality control is not defined. Testing processes are an example. 
  <LI>An unknown number of development processes that bridge known but uncontrolled 
    processes are unidentified. Detailed processes to ensure that a logical model 
    contains adequate content to lead to a successful physical model is one such 
    process. 
  <LI>Environmental input (requirements) can only be taken into consideration 
    at the beginning of the process. Complex change management procedures are 
    required thereafter. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Attempts to impose a micro, or detailed, methodology model on the development 
  process have not worked because the development process is still not completely 
  defined. Acting as though the development process is defined and predictable 
  results in being unprepared for the unpredictable results. </P>
<P>Although the development process is incompletely defined and dynamic, numerous 
  organizations have developed detailed development methodologies that include 
  current development methods (structured, OO, etc.). The Waterfall methodology 
  was one of the first such defined system development processes. A picture of 
  the Waterfall methodology is shown in Figure 1. <BR>
  <IMG height=195 
alt="Waterfall Methodology Illustration" 
src="../images/s1m.gif" width=507> <BR>
  Figure 1 </P>
<P>Although the waterfall approach mandates the use of undefined processes, its 
  linear nature has been its largest problem. The process does not define how 
  to respond to unexpected output from any of the intermediate process. </P>
<P>Barry Boehm introduced a Spiral methodology to address this problem. Each of 
  the waterfall phases is ended with a risk assessment and prototyping activity. 
  The Spiral methodology is shown in Figure 2. </P>
<P>The Spiral methodology "peels the onion", progressing through "layers" of the 
  development process. A prototype lets users determine if the project is on track, 
  should be sent back to prior phases, or should be ended. However, the phases 
  and phase processes are still linear. Requirements work is still performed in 
  the requirements phase, design work in the design phase, and so forth, with 
  each of the phases consisting of linear, explicitly defined processes. </P>
<P><IMG height=238 alt="Spiral Methodology Illustration" 
src="../images/s2m.gif" width=432> <BR>
  Figure 2 </P>
<P>The Iterative methodology improves on the Spiral methodology. Each iteration 
  consists of all of the standard Waterfall phases, but each iteration only addresses 
  one set of parsed functionality. The overall project deliverable has been partitioned 
  into prioritized subsystems, each with clean interfaces. Using this approach, 
  one can test the feasibility of a subsystem and technology in the initial iterations. 
  Further iterations can add resources to the project while ramping up the speed 
  of delivery. This approach improves cost control, ensures delivery of systems 
  (albeit subsystems), and improves overall flexibility. However, the Iterative 
  approach still expects that the underlying development processes are defined 
  and linear. See Figure 3. </P>
<P><IMG height=266 alt="Iterative Methodology Illustration" 
src="../images/s3m.gif" width=500> <BR>
  Figure 3 </P>
<P>Given the complex environment and the increased reliance on new "state-of-the-art" 
  systems, the risk endured by system development projects has increased and the 
  search for mechanisms to handle this risk has intensified. One can argue that 
  current methodologies are better than nothing. Each improves on the other. The 
  Spiral and Iterative approaches implant formal risk control mechanisms for dealing 
  with unpredictable results. A framework for development is provided. </P>
<P>However, each rests on the fallacy that the development processes are defined, 
  predictable processes. But unpredictable results occur throughout the projects. 
  The rigor implied in the development processes stifles the flexibility needed 
  to cope with the unpredictable results and respond to a complex environment. 
</P>
<P>Despite their widespread presence in the development community, people don't 
  use the methodologies except as a macro process map, or for their detailed method 
  descriptions. </P>
<P>The following graph demonstrates the current development environment, using 
  any of the Waterfall, Spiral or Iterative processes. As the complexity of the 
  variables increase even to a moderate level, the probability of a "successful" 
  project quickly diminishes (a successful project is defined as a system that 
  is useful when delivered). See Figure 4.</P>

<H2><A name=Methodology>Methodology </A></H2>
<P>The system development process is complicated and complex. Therefore maximum 
  flexibility and appropriate control is required. Evolution favors those that 
  operate with maximum exposure to environmental change and have maximized flexibility. 
  Evolution deselects those who have insulated themselves from environmental change 
  and have minimized chaos and complexity in their environment. </P>
<P>An approach is needed that enables development teams to operate adaptively 
  within a complex environment using imprecise processes. Complex system development 
  occurs under chaotic circumstances. Producing orderly systems under chaotic 
  circumstances requires maximum flexibility. The closer the development team 
  operates to the edge of chaos, the more competitive and useful the resulting 
  system will be. </P>
<P>Methodology may well be the most important factor in determining the probability 
  of success. Methodologies that encourage and support flexibility have a high 
  degree of tolerance for changes in other variables. With these methodologies, 
  the development process is regarded as unpredictable at the onset, and control 
  mechanisms are put in place to manage the unpredictability. </P>
<P>If we graph the relationship between environmental complexity and probability 
  of success with a flexible methodology that incorporates controls and risk management, 
  the tolerance for change is more durable. See Figure 5. </P>
<P><IMG height=368 alt="Risk/Complexity Comparison Illustration" 
src="../images/s5m.gif" width=476> <BR>
  Figure 5 </P>
<P>Figures 4 and 5 reflect software development experiences at ADM, Easel, Vmark, 
  Borland and virtually every other developer of "packaged" software. These organizations 
  have embraced risk and environmental complexity during development projects. 
  Increased product impact, successful projects, and productivity gains were experienced. 
  The best possible software is built. </P>
<P>Waterfall and Spiral methodologies set the context and deliverable definition 
  at the start of a project. SCRUM and Iterative methodologies initially plan 
  the context and broad deliverable definition, and then evolve the deliverable 
  during the project based on the environment. SCRUM acknowledges that the underlying 
  development processes are incompletely defined and uses control mechanisms to 
  improve flexibility. </P>
<P>The primary difference between the defined (waterfall, spiral and iterative) 
  and empirical (SCRUM) approach is that The SCRUM approach assumes that the analysis, 
  design, and development processes in the Sprint phase are unpredictable. A control 
  mechanism is used to manage the unpredictability and control the risk. Flexibility, 
  responsiveness, and reliability are the results. See Figure 6. </P>

<P>Characteristics of SCRUM methodology are : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The first and last phases (Planning and Closure) consist of defined processes, 
    where all processes, inputs and outputs are well defined. The knowledge of 
    how to do these processes is explicit. The flow is linear, with some iterations 
    in the planning phase. 
  <LI>The Sprint phase is an empirical process. Many of the processes in the sprint 
    phase are unidentified or uncontrolled. It is treated as a black box that 
    requires external controls. Accordingly, controls, including risk management, 
    are put on each iteration of the Sprint phase to avoid chaos while maximizing 
    flexibility. 
  <LI>Sprints are nonlinear and flexible. Where available, explicit process knowledge 
    is used; otherwise tacit knowledge and trial and error is used to build process 
    knowledge. Sprints are used to evolve the final product. 
  <LI>The project is open to the environment until the Closure phase. The deliverable 
    can be changed at any time during the Planning and Sprint phases of the project. 
    The project remains open to environmental complexity, including competitive, 
    time, quality, and financial pressures, throughout these phases. 
  <LI>The deliverable is determined during the project based on the environment.

</UL>
<P><B>Development (Sprint)</B> - the Development phase is an iterative cycle of 
  development work. The management determines that time, competition, quality, 
  or functionality are met, iterations are completed and the closure phase occurs. 
  This approach is also known as Concurrent Engineering. Development consists 
  of the following macro processes : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Meeting with teams to review release plans. 
  <LI>Distribution, review and adjustment of the standards with which the product 
    will conform. 
  <LI>Iterative Sprints, until the product is deemed ready for distribution. </LI>
</UL>
<P>A Sprint is a set of development activities conducted over a pre-defined period, 
  usually one or four weeks. The interval is based on product complexity, risk 
  assessment, and degree of oversight desired. Sprint speed and intensity are 
  driven by the selected duration of the Sprint. Risk is assessed continuously 
  and adequate risk controls and responses put in place. Each Sprint consists 
  of one or more teams performing the following: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Develop: Defining changes needed for the implementation of backlog requirements 
    into packets, opening the packets, performing domain analysis, designing, 
    developing, implementing, testing, and documenting the changes. Development 
    consists of the micro process of discovery, invention, and implementation. 
  <LI>Wrap: Closing the packets, creating a executable version of changes and 
    how they implement backlog requirements. 
  <LI>Review: All teams meeting to present work and review progress, raising and 
    resolving issues and problems, adding new backlog items. Risk is reviewed 
    and appropriate responses defined. 
  <LI>Adjust: Consolidating the information gathered from the review meeting into 
    affected packets, including different look and feel and new properties. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Each Sprint is followed by a review, whose characteristics are : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The whole team and product management are present and participate. 
  <LI>The review can include customers, sales, marketing and others. 
  <LI>Review covers functional, executable systems that encompass the objects 
    assigned to that team and include the changes made to implement the backlog 
    items. 
  <LI>The way backlog items are implemented by changes may be changed based on 
    the review. 
  <LI>New backlog items may be introduced and assigned to teams as part of the 
    review, changing the content and direction of deliverables. 
  <LI>The time of the next review is determined based on progress and complexity. 
    The Sprints usually have a duration of 1 to 4 weeks. </LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Closure</B> - When the management team feels that the variables of time, 
  competition, requirements, cost, and quality concur for a new release to occur, 
  they declare the release "closed" and enter this phase. This phase prepares 
  the developed product for general release. Integration, system test, user documentation, 
  training material preparation, and marketing material preparation are among 
  closure tasks. </P>
<HR>
<H2><A name=Controls>Controls </A></H2>
<P>Operating at the edge of chaos (unpredictability and complexity) requires management 
  controls to avoid falling into chaos. The SCRUM methodology embodies these general, 
  loose controls, using OO techniques for the actual construction of deliverables. 
</P>
<P>Risk is the primary control. Risk assessment leads to changes in other controls 
  and responses by the team. </P>
<P>Controls in the SCRUM methodology are : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Backlog: Product functionality requirements that are not adequately addressed 
    by the current product release. Bugs, defects, customer requested enhancements, 
    competitive product functionality, competitive edge functionality, and technology 
    upgrades are backlog items. 
  <LI>Release/Enhancement: backlog items that at a point in time represent a viable 
    release based on the variables of requirements, time, quality, and competition. 
  <LI>Packets: Product components or objects that must be changed to implement 
    a backlog item into a new release. 
  <LI>Changes: Changes that must occur to a packet to implement a backlog item. 
  <LI>Problems: Technical problems that occur and must be solved to implement 
    a change. 
  <LI>Risks: risks that effect the success of the project are continuously assessed 
    and responses planned. Other controls are affected as a result of risk assessment. 
  <LI>Solutions: solutions to the problems and risks, often resulting in changes. 
  <LI>Issues: Overall project and project issues that are not defined in terms 
    of packets, changes and problems. </LI>
</UL>
<P>These controls are used in the various phases of SCRUM. Management uses these 
  controls to manage backlog. Teams use these controls to manage changes, problems. 
  Both management and teams jointly manage issues, risks, and solutions. These 
  controls are reviewed, modified, and reconciled at every Sprint review meeting.

<H2><A name=Deliverables>Deliverables </A></H2>
<P>The delivered product is flexible. Its content is determined by environment 
  variables, including time, competition, cost, or functionality. The deliverable 
  determinants are market intelligence, customer contact, and the skill of developers. 
  Frequent adjustments to deliverable content occur during the project in response 
  to environment. The deliverable can be determined anytime during the project. 
</P>
<HR>

<P>The team that works on the new release includes full time developers and external 
  parties who will be affected by the new release, such as marketing, sales, and 
  customers. In traditional release processes, these latter groups are kept away 
  from development teams for fear of over-complicating the process and providing 
  "unnecessary" interference. The SCRUM approach, however, welcomes and facilitates 
  their controlled involvement at set intervals, as this increases the probability 
  that release content and timing will be appropriate, useful, and marketable. 
</P>
<P>The following teams are formed for each new release: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Management: Led by the Product Manager, it defines initial content and timing 
    of the release, then manages their evolution as the project progresses and 
    variables change. Management deals with backlog, risk, and release content. 
  <LI>Development teams: Development teams are small, with each containing developers, 
    documenters and quality control staff. One or more teams of between three 
    and six people each are used. Each is assigned a set of packets (or objects), 
    including all backlog items related to each packet. The team defines changes 
    required to implement the backlog item in the packets, and manages all problems 
    regarding the changes. Teams can be either functionally derived (assigned 
    those packets that address specific sets of product functionality) or system 
    derived (assigned unique layers of the system). The members of each team are 
    selected based on their knowledge and expertise regarding sets of packets, 
    or domain expertise. </LI>

<P><CITE>SCRUM projects have the following characteristics :</CITE> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Flexible deliverable - the content of the deliverable is dictated by the 
    environment. 
  <LI>Flexible schedule - the deliverable may be required sooner or later than 
    initially planned. 
  <LI>Small teams - each team has no more than 6 members. There may be multiple 
    teams within a project. 
  <LI>Frequent reviews - team progress is reviewed as frequently as environmental 
    complexity and risk dictates (usually 1 to 4 week cycles). A functional executable 
    must be prepared by each team for each review. 
  <LI>Collaboration - intra and inter-collaboration is expected during the project. 
  <LI>Object Oriented - each team will address a set of related objects, with

<P>Additional development methodologies are designed only to respond to the unpredictability 
  of the external and development environments at the start of an enhancement 
  cycle. Such newer approaches as the Boehm spiral methodology and its variants 
  are still limited in their ability to respond to changing requirements once 
  the project has started. </P>
<P>The SCRUM methodology, on the other hand, is designed to be quite flexible 
  throughout. It provides control mechanisms for planning a product release and 
  then managing variables as the project progresses. This enables organizations 
  to change the project and deliverables at any point in time, delivering the 
  most appropriate release. </P>
<P>The SCRUM methodology frees developers to devise the most ingenious solutions 
  throughout the project, as learning occurs and the environment changes. </P>
<P>Small, collaborative teams of developers are able to share tacit knowledge 
  about development processes. An excellent training environment for all parties 
  is provided. </P>
<P>Object Oriented technology provides the basis for the SCRUM methodology. Objects, 
  or product features, offer a discrete and manageable environment. Procedural 
  code, with its many and intertwined interfaces, is inappropriate for the SCRUM 
  methodology. SCRUM may be selectively applied to procedural systems with clean 
  interfaces and strong data orientation. </P>

<H2><A name=Estimating>Estimating </A></H2>
<P>SCRUM projects can be estimated using standard function point estimating. However, 
  it is advisable to estimate productivity at approximately twice the current 
  metric. The estimate is only for starting purposes, however, since the overall 
  timetable and cost are determined dynamically in response to the environmental 
  factors. </P>
<P>Our observations have led us to conclude that SCRUM projects have both velocity 
  and acceleration. In terms of functions delivered, or backlog items completed 
  : </P>
<UL>
  <LI>initial velocity and acceleration are low as infrastructure is built/modified 
  <LI>as base functionality is put into objects, acceleration increases 
  <LI>acceleration decreases and velocity remains sustainably high </LI>

<P>Further development in metrics for empirical processes is required. </P>

<H3>System Development Methodologies : Defined or Empirical </H3>
<P>System development is the act of creating a logical construct that is implemented 
  as logic and data on computers. The logical construct consists of inputs, processes, 
  and outputs, both macro (whole construct) and micro (intermediate steps within 
  whole construct). The whole is known as an implemented system. </P>
<P>Many artifacts are created while building the system. Artifacts may be used 
  to guide thinking, check completeness, and create an audit trail. The artifacts 
  consist of documents, models, programs, test cases, and other deliverables created 
  prior to creating the implemented system. When available, a <I>metamodel</I> 
  defines the semantic content of model artifacts. <I>Notation</I> describes the 
  graphing and documentation conventions that are used to build the models. </P>
<P>The approach used to develop a system is known as a <I>method</I>. A <I>method</I> 
  describes the activities involved in defining, building, and implementing a 
  system; a <I>method</I> is a framework. Since a <I>method</I> is a logical process 
  for constructing systems (process), it is known as a <I>metaprocess</I> (a process 
  for modeling processes). </P>
<P>A <I>method</I> has micro and macro components. The macro components define 
  the overall flow and time-sequenced framework for performing work. The micro 
  components include <I>general design rules, patterns and rules of thumb</I>. 
  <I>General design rules</I> state properties to achieve or to avoid in the design 
  or general approaches to take while building a system. <I>Patterns</I> are solutions 
  that can be applied to a type of development activity; they are solutions waiting 
  for problems that occur during an activity in a method. <I>Rules of thumb</I> 
  consist of a general body of hints and tips. </P>
<P>Applying concepts from industrial process control to the field of systems development, 
  <I>methods</I> can be categorized as either "theoretical" (fully defined) or 
  "empirical" (black box). </P>
<P><EM>Correctly categorizing systems development methods is critical</EM>. The 
  appropriate structure of a <I>method</I> for building a particular type of system 
  depends on whether the method is theoretical or empirical. </P>
<P>Models of <I>theoretical processes</I> are derived from <I>first principles</I>, 
  using material and energy balances and fundamental laws to determine the model. 
  For a systems development <I>method</I> to be categorized as theoretical, it 
  must conform to this definition. </P>
<P>Models of empirical processes are derived categorizing observed inputs and 
  outputs, and defining controls that cause them to occur within prescribed bounds. 
  Empirical process modeling involves constructing a process model strictly from 
  experimentally obtained input/output data, with no recourse to any laws concerning 
  the fundamental nature and properties of the system. No <I>a priori</I> knowledge 
  about the process is necessary (although it can be helpful); a system is treated 
  like a black box.<BR>
</P>
<P>Upon inspection, we assert that the systems development process is empirical: 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Applicable first principles are not present 
  <LI>The process is only beginning to be understood 
  <LI>The process is complex 
  <LI>The process is changing </LI>
</UL>
<P>Most methodologists agree with this assertion; "...you can't expect a <I>method</I> 
  to tell you everything to do. Writing software is a creative process, like painting 
  or writing or architecture... ... (a <I>method</I>) supplies a framework that 
  tells how to go about it and identifies the places where creativity is needed. 
  But you still have to supply the creativity...." </P>
<P>Categorizing the systems development methods as empirical is critical to the 
  effective management of the systems development process. </P>
<P>If systems development <I>methods</I> are categorized as <I>empirical</I>, 
  measurements and controls are required because it is understood that the inner 
  workings of the <I>method</I> are so loosely defined that they cannot be counted 
  on to operate predictably. </P>
<P>In the past, <I>methods</I> have been provided and applied as though they were 
  theoretical. As a consequence, measurements were not relied upon and controls 
  dependent upon the measurements weren't used. </P>
<P>Many of the problems in developing systems have occurred because of this incorrect 
  categorization. When a black box process is treated as a fully defined process, 
  unpredictable results occur. Also, the controls are not in place to measure 
  and respond to the unpredictability. </P>
