<B><FONT SIZE=4><LI>What Is the Rational Unified Process?</LI></UL>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The Rational Unified Process is a Software Engineering Process. It provides a disciplined approach to assigning tasks and responsibilities within a development organization. Its goal is to ensure the production of high-quality software that meets the needs of its end-users, within a predictable schedule and budget. [11, 13]</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process is a process product, developed and maintained by Rational? Software. The development team for the Rational Unified Process are working closely with customers, partners, Rational's product groups as well as Rational's consultant organization, to ensure that the process is continuously updated and improved upon to reflect recent experiences and evolving and proven best practices.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process enhances team productivity, by providing every team member with easy access to a knowledge base with guidelines, templates and tool mentors for all critical development activities. By having all team members accessing the same knowledge base, no matter if you work with requirements, design, test, project management, or configuration management, we ensure that all team members share a common language, process and view of how to develop software.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process activities create and maintain models. Rather than focusing on the production of large amount of paper documents, the Unified Process emphasizes the development and maintenance of models--semantically rich representations of the software system under development. [3, 7, 8]</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process is a guide for how to effectively use the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The UML is a industry-standard language that allows us to clearly communicate requirements, architectures and designs. The UML was originally created by Rational Software, and is now maintained by the standards organization Object Management Group (OMG). [4]</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process is supported by tools, which automate large parts of the process. They are used to create and maintain the various artifacts-models in particular-of the software engineering process: visual modeling, programming, testing, etc. They are invaluable in supporting all the bookkeeping associated with the change management as well as the configuration management that accompanies each iteration.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process is a configurable process. No single process is suitable for all software development. The Unified Process fits small development teams as well as large development organizations. The Unified Process is founded on a simple and clear process architecture that provides commonality across a family of processes. Yet, it can be varied to accommodate different situations. It contains a Development Kit, providing support for configuring the process to suit the needs of a given organization.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process captures many of the best practices in modern software development in a form that is suitable for a wide range of projects and organizations. Deploying these best practices<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">u</FONT>sing the Rational Unified Process as your guide<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">o</FONT>ffers development teams a number of key advantages. In next section, we describe the six fundamental best practices of the Rational Unified Process.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The Rational Unified Process describes how to effectively deploy commercially proven approaches to software development for software development teams. These are called "best practices" not so much because you can precisely quantify their value, but rather, because they are observed to be commonly used in industry by successful organizations. The Rational Unified Process provides each team member with the guidelines, templates and tool mentors necessary for the entire team to take full advantage of among others the following best practices:</P>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><B><I><P>Develop Software Iteratively</B></I>--Given today's sophisticated software systems, it is not possible to sequentially first define the entire problem, design the entire solution, build the software and then test the product at the end. An iterative approach is required that allows an increasing understanding of the problem through successive refinements, and to incrementally grow an effective solution over multiple iterations. The Rational Unified Process supports an iterative approach to development that addresses the highest risk items at every stage in the lifecycle, significantly reducing a project's risk profile. This iterative approach helps you attack risk through demonstrable progress<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">f</FONT>requent, executable releases that enable continuous end user involvement and feedback. Because each iteration ends with an executable release, the development team stays focused on producing results, and frequent status checks help ensure that the project stays on schedule. An iterative approach also makes it easier to accommodate tactical changes in requirements, features or schedule. [1, 2, 10]</P>

<B><I><P>Manage Requirements</B></I>--The Rational Unified Process describes how to elicit, organize, and document required functionality and constraints; track and document tradeoffs and decisions; and easily capture and communicate business requirements. The notions of use case and scenarios proscribed in the process has proven to be an excellent way to capture functional requirements and to ensure that these drive the design, implementation and testing of software, making it more likely that the final system fulfills the end user needs. They provide coherent and traceable threads through both the development and the delivered system. [7]</P>

<B><I><P>Use Component-Based Architectures</I>-</B>-The process focuses on early development and baselining of a robust executable architecture, prior to committing resources for full-scale development. It describes how to design a resilient architecture that is flexible, accommodates change, is intuitively understandable, and promotes more effective software reuse. The Rational Unified Process supports component-based software development. Components are non-trivial modules, subsystems that fulfill a clear function. The Rational Unified Process provides a systematic approach to defining an architecture using new and existing components. These are assembled in a well-defined architecture, either ad hoc, or in a component infrastructure such as the Internet, CORBA, and COM, for which an industry of reusable components is emerging. [5]</P>

<B><I><P>Visually Model Software</B></I>--The process shows you how to visually model software to capture the structure and behavior of architectures and components. This allows you to hide the details and write code using "graphical building blocks." Visual abstractions help you communicate different aspects of your software; see how the elements of the system fit together; make sure that the building blocks are consistent with your code; maintain consistency between a design and its implementation; and promote unambiguous communication. The industry-standard Unified Modeling Language (UML), created by Rational Software, is the foundation for successful visual modeling. [4, 12]</P>

<B><I><P>Verify Software Quality</B></I>--Poor application performance and poor reliability are common factors which dramatically inhibit the acceptability of today's software applications. Hence, quality should be reviewed with respect to the requirements based on reliability, functionality, application performance and system performance. The Rational Unified Process assists you in the planning, design, implementation, execution, and evaluation of these test types. Quality assessment is built into the process, in all activities, involving all participants, using objective measurements and criteria, and not treated as an afterthought or a separate activity performed by a separate group.</P>

<B><I><P>Control Changes to Software</B></I>--The ability to manage change--making certain that each change is acceptable, and being able to track changes--is essential in an environment in which change is inevitable. The process describes how to control, track and monitor changes to enable successful iterative development. It also guides you in how to establish secure workspaces for each developer by providing isolation from changes made in other workspaces and by controlling changes of all software artifacts (e.g., models, code, documents, etc.). And it brings a team together to work as a single unit by describing how to automate integration and build management.</P>

</FONT><B><P>During the inception phase, you establish the business case for the system and delimit the</B> <B>project scope</B>.

</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN"><P><IMG SRC="Image19.gif" WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=23></P>

<P>　</P>
</FONT><B><P>The purpose of the elaboration phase is to analyze the problem domain, establish a sound architectural foundation, develop the project plan, and eliminate the highest risk elements of the project.</B> To accomplish these objectives, you must have the "mile wide and inch deep" view of the system. Architectural decisions have to be made with an understanding of the whole system: its scope, major functionality and nonfunctional requirements such as performance requirements.</P>

<P>It is easy to argue that the elaboration phase is the most critical of the four phases. At the end of this phase, the hard "engineering" is considered complete and the project undergoes its most important day of reckoning: the decision on whether or not to commit to the construction and transition phases. For most projects, this also corresponds to the transition from a mobile, light and nimble, low-risk operation to a high-cost, high-risk operation with substantial inertia. While the process must always accommodate changes, the elaboration phase activities ensure that the architecture, requirements and plans are stable enough, and the risks are sufficiently mitigated, so you can predictably determine the cost and schedule for the completion of the development. Conceptually, this level of fidelity would correspond to the level necessary for an organization to commit to a fixed-price construction phase.</P>

<P>In the elaboration phase, an executable architecture prototype is built in one or more iterations, depending on the scope, size, risk, and novelty of the project. This effort should at least address the critical use cases identified in the inception phase, which typically expose the major technical risks of the project. While an evolutionary prototype of a production-quality component is always the goal, this does not exclude the development of one or more exploratory, throw-away prototypes to mitigate specific risks such as design/requirements trade-offs, component feasibility study, or demonstrations to investors, customers, and end-users.</P>

<P>The outcome of the elaboration phase is: </P>


<UL>
<LI>A use-case model (at least 80% complete) - all use cases and actors have been identified, and most use-case descriptions have been developed. </LI>
<LI>Supplementary requirements capturing the non functional requirements and any requirements that are not associated with a specific use case. </LI>
<LI>A Software Architecture Description. </LI>

<P>The main evaluation criteria for the elaboration phase involves the answers to these questions: </P>


<UL>
<LI>Is the vision of the product stable? </LI>
<LI>Is the architecture stable? </LI>
<LI>Does the executable demonstration show that the major risk elements have been addressed and credibly resolved? </LI>

<LI>Do all stakeholders agree that the current vision can be achieved if the current plan is executed to develop the complete system, in the context of the current architecture? </LI>
<LI>Is the actual resource expenditure versus planned expenditure acceptable? </LI></UL>

<P>　</P>
</FONT><B><P>During the construction phase, all remaining components and application features are developed and integrated into the product, and all features are thoroughly tested. </B>The construction phase is, in one sense, a manufacturing process where emphasis is placed on managing resources and controlling operations to optimize costs, schedules, and quality. In this sense, the management mindset undergoes a transition from the development of intellectual property during inception and elaboration, to the development of deployable products during construction and transition.</P>

<P>Many projects are large enough that parallel construction increments can be spawned. These parallel activities can significantly accelerate the availability of deployable releases; they can also increase the complexity of resource management and workflow synchronization. A robust architecture and an understandable plan are highly correlated. In other words, one of the critical qualities of the architecture is its ease of construction. This is one reason why the balanced development of the architecture and the plan is stressed during the elaboration phase.</P>

<P>The outcome of the construction phase is a product ready to put in hands of its end-users. At minimum, it consists of: </P>

You could regard a worker as a "hat" an individual can wear in the project. One individual may wear many different hats. This is an important distinction because it is natural to think of a worker as the individual or team itself, but in the Unified Process the worker is more the role defining how the individuals should carry out the work.

The activity has a clear purpose, usually expressed in terms of creating or updating some artifacts, such as a model, a class, a plan. Every activity is assigned to a specific worker. The granularity of an activity is generally a few hours to a few days, it usually involves one worker, and affects one or only a small number of artifacts. An activity should be usable as an element of planning and progress; if it is too small, it will be neglected, and if it is too large, progress would have to be expressed in terms of an activity's parts.</P>

In next section we will discuss the most essential type of workflows in the process, called Core Workflows.</P>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>Although the names of the six core engineering workflows may evoke the sequential phases in a traditional waterfall process, we should keep in mind that the phases of an iterative process are different and that these workflows are revisited again and again throughout the lifecycle. The actual complete workflow of a project interleaves these nine core workflows, and repeats them with various emphasis and intensity at each iteration.</P>

<B><P>Business Modeling</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>One of the major problems with most business engineering efforts, is that the software engineering and the business engineering community do not communicate properly with each other. This leads to that the output from business engineering is not used properly as input to the software development effort, and vice-versa. The Rational Unified Process addresses this by providing a common language and process for both communities, as well as showing how to create and maintain direct traceability between business and software models.</P>

<P>In Business Modeling we document business processes using so called business use cases. This assures a common understanding among all stakeholders of what business process needs to be supported in the organization. The business use cases are analyzed to understand how the business should support the business processes. This is documented in a business object-model.</P>

<P>Many projects may choose not to do business modeling.</P>

<B><P>Requirements</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The goal of the Requirements workflow is to describe what the system should do and allows the developers and the customer to agree on that description. To achieve this, we elicit, organize, and document required functionality and constraints; track and document tradeoffs and decisions.</P>

<P>A Vision document is created, and stakeholder needs are elicited. Actors are identified, representing the users, and any other system that may interact with the system being developed. Use cases are identified, representing the behavior of the system. Because use cases are developed according to the actor's needs, the system is more likely to be relevant to the users. The following figure shows an example of a use-case model for a recycling-machine system.</P>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN"><P><IMG SRC="Image29.gif" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=170></P>

</FONT><B><U><P>An example of a use-case model with actors and use cases.</P>
</B></U><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
<P>　</P>
</FONT><P>Each use case is described in detail. The use-case description shows how the system interacts step by step with the actors and what the system does. Non-functional requirements are described in Supplementary Specifications.</P>

<P>The use cases function as a unifying thread throughout the system's development cycle. The same use-case model is used during requirements capture, analysis &amp; design, and test.</P>

<B><P>Analysis and Design</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The goal of the Analysis and Design workflow is to show how the system will be realized in the implementation phase. You want to build a system that: </P>


<UL>
<LI>Performs-in a specific implementation environment-the tasks and functions specified in the use-case descriptions. </LI>
<LI>Fulfills all its requirements. </LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Is structured to be robust (easy to change if and when its functional requirements change). </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>Analysis and Design results in a design model and optionally an analysis model. The design model serves as an abstraction of the source code; that is, the design model acts as a 'blueprint' of how the source code is structured and written.</P>

<P>The design model consists of design classes structured into design packages and design subsystems with well-defined interfaces, representing what will become components in the implementation. It also contains descriptions of how objects of these design classes collaborate to perform use cases. The next figure shows part of a sample design model for the recycling-machine system in the use-case model shown in the previous figure.</P>

</FONT><B><P>Part of a design model with communicating design classes and package group design classes.</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
<P>　</P>
</FONT><P>The design activities are centered around the notion of architecture. The production and validation of this architecture is the main focus of early design iterations. Architecture is represented by a number of architectural views [9]. These views capture the major structural design decisions. In essence, architectural views are abstractions or simplifications of the entire design, in which important characteristics are made more visible by leaving details aside. The architecture is an important vehicle not only for developing a good design model, but also for increasing the quality of any model built during system development.</P>

<B><P>Implementation</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The purpose of implementation are: </P>


<UL>
<LI>To define the organization of the code, in terms of implementation subsystems organized in layers. </LI>
<LI>To implement classes and objects in terms of components (source files, binaries, executables, and others). </LI>
<LI>To test the developed components as units. </LI>
<LI>To integrate the results produced by individual implementers (or teams), into an executable system. </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The system is realized through implementation of components. The Rational Unified Process describes how you reuse existing components, or implement new components with well defined responsibility, making the system easier to maintain, and increasing the possibilities to reuse.</P>
<P>Components are structured into Implementation Subsystems. Subsystems take the form of directories, with additional structural or management information. For example, a subsystem can be created as a directory or a folder in a file system, or a subsystem in Rational/Apex for C++ or Ada, or packages using Java.</P>

<B><P>Test</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The purposes of testing are: </P>


<UL>
<LI>To verify the interaction between objects. </LI>
<LI>To verify the proper integration of all components of the software. </LI>
<LI>To verify that all requirements have been correctly implemented. </LI>
<LI>To identify and ensure defects are addressed prior to the deployment of the software. </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The Rational Unified Process proposes an iterative approach, which means that you test throughout the project. This allows you to find defects as early as possible, which radically reduces the cost of fixing the defect. Test are carried out along three quality dimensions reliability, functionality, application performance and system performance. For each of these quality dimensions, the process describes how you go through the test lifecycle of planning, design, implementation, execution and evaluation.</P>
<P>Strategies for when and how to automate test are described. Test automation is especially important using an iterative approach, to allow regression testing at then end of each iteration, as well as for each new version of the product.</P>

<B><P>Deployment</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The purpose of the deployment workflow is to successfully produce product releases, and deliver the software to its end users. It covers a wide range of activities including: </P>


<UL>
<LI>Producing external releases of the software </LI>
<LI>Packaging the software </LI>
<LI>Distributing the software </LI>
<LI>Installing the software </LI>
<LI>Providing help and assistance to users </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>In many cases, this also includes activities such as: </P>


<UL>
<LI>Planning and conduct of beta tests </LI>
<LI>Migration of existing software or data </LI>
<LI>Formal acceptance </LI></UL>

<P>Although deployment activities are mostly centered around the transition phase, many of the activities need to be included in earlier phases to prepare for deployment at the end of the construction phase.</P>
<P>The Deployment and Environment workflows of the Rational Unified Process contain less detail than other workflows.</P>

<P>　</P>
<P>　</P>
<P>　</P>
<B><P>Project Management</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>Software Project Management is the art of balancing competing objectives, managing risk, and overcoming constraints to deliver, successfully, a product which meets the needs of both customers (the payers of bills) and the users. The fact that so few projects are unarguably successful is comment enough on the difficulty of the task.</P>

<P>This workflow focuses mainly on the specific aspect of an iterative development process. Our goal with this section is to make the task easier by providing: </P>


<UL>
<LI>A framework for managing software-intensive projects </LI>
<LI>Practical guidelines for planning, staffing, executing, and monitoring projects </LI>
<LI>A framework for managing risk </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>It is not a recipe for success, but it presents an approach to managing the project that will markedly improve the odds of delivering successful software. [14]</P>

<B><P>Configuration and Change Management</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>In this workflow we describe how to control the numerous artifacts produced by the many people who work on a common project. Control helps avoid costly confusion, and ensures that resultant artifacts are not in conflict due to some of the following kinds of problems: </P>


<UL>
<LI>Simultaneous Update--When two or more workers work separately on the same artifact, the last one to make changes destroys the work of the former. </LI>
<LI>Limited Notification--When a problem is fixed in artifacts shared by several developers, and some of them are not notified of the change. </LI>
<LI>Multiple Versions--Most large programs are developed in evolutionary releases. One release could be in customer use, while another is in test, and the third is still in development. If problems are found in any one of the versions, fixes need to be propagated between them. Confusion can arise leading to costly fixes and re-work unless changes are carefully controlled and monitored. </LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>This workflow provides guidelines for managing multiple variants of evolving software systems, tracking which versions are used in given software builds, performing builds of individual programs or entire releases according to user-defined version specifications, and enforcing site-specific development policies.</P>

<P>We describe how you can manage parallel development, development done at multiple sites, and how to automate the build process. This is especially important in an iterative process where you may want to be able to do builds as often as daily, something that would become impossible without powerful automation. We also describe how you can keep an audit trail on why, when and by whom any artifact was changed.</P>

<P>This workflow also covers change request management, i.e. how to report defects, manage them through their lifecycle, and how to use defect data to track progress and trends.</P>

<B><P>Environment</P>
</B><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>The purpose of the environment workflow is to provide the software development organization with the software development environment--both processes and tools--that are needed to support the development team.</P>

<P>This workflow focuses on the activities to configure the process in the context of a project. It also focus on activities to develop the guidelines needed to support a project. A step-by-step procedure is provided describing how you implement a process in an organization.</P>

<P>The environment workflow also contains a Development Kit providing you with the guidelines, templates and tools necessary to customize the process. The Development Kit is described in more detail in the section " Development Kit for Process Customization" found later in this paper.</P>

However in many circumstances, this software engineering process will need to be modified, adjusted, and tailored to accommodate the specific characteristics, constraints, and history of the adopting organization.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN">
</FONT><P>A software-engineering process requires tools to support all activities in a system's lifecycle, especially to support the development, maintenance and bookkeeping of various artifacts-models in particular. An iterative development process puts special requirements on the tool set you use, such as better integration among tools and round-trip engineering between models and code. You also need tools to keep track of changes, to support requirements traceability, to automate documentation, as well as tools to automate tests to facilitate regression test. The Rational Unified Process can be used with a variety of tools, either from Rational or other vendors. However, Rational provides many well-integrated tools that efficiently support the Rational Unified Process.</P>

<P>Below you find a list of some of Rational's tools that support the Rational Unified Process.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process contains Tool Mentors for almost all of these products. A tool mentor is a step-by-step guide describing in detail how to operate a tool, (i.e. what menus to launch, what information to enter into dialog boxes, and how to navigate a tool) to carry out an activity within the process. The Tool Mentors allow us to link the tool-independent process to the actual manipulation of the tools in your daily work.</P>

</B></FONT><P>The Rational Unified Process has matured over many years and reflects the collective experience of the many people and companies that make up today Rational Software's rich heritage.</P>

<P>Let us have a quick look at the process's ancestry, as illustrated in the figure below.</P>

</FONT><P>Genealogy of the Rational Unified Process</P>
</B></U><FONT FACE="宋体" LANG="ZH-CN"><P><IMG SRC="Image32.gif" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=227></P>

</FONT><P>Going backwards in time, the Rational Unified Process is the direct successor to the Rational Objectory Process (version 4). The Rational Unified Process incorporates more material in the areas of data engineering, business modeling, project management, and configuration management, the latter as a result of the merger with Pure-Atria. It also brings a tighter integration to the Rational Software suite of tools.</P>

<P>The Rational Objectory Process was the result of the integration of the "Rational Approach" and the Objectory Process (version 3), after the merger of Rational Software Corporation and Objectory AB in 1995. From its Objectory ancestry, the process has inherited its process structure and the central concept of use case. From its Rational background, it gained the current formulation of iterative development and architecture. This version also incorporated material on requirements management from Requisite, Inc. and a detailed test process inherited from SQA?, Inc., companies which also merged with Rational Software. Finally, this process was the first one to use the newly created Unified Modeling Language (UML 0.8).</P>

<P>The Objectory process was created in Sweden in 1987 by Ivar Jacobson as the result of his experience with Ericsson. This process became a product at his company, Objectory AB. Centered around the concept of use case and an object-oriented design method, it rapidly gained recognition in the software industry and has been adopted and integrated by many companies worldwide. A simplified version of the Objectory process was published as a text book in 1992.</P>

<P>The Rational Unified Process is a specific and detailed instance of a more generic process described by Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch, and James Rumbaugh in the textbook, The Unified Software Development Process.</P>
