              factor, for example, might be that the product is already &quot;old&quot; 
              and useless by the time it is developed; that is, it is based on 
              out-of-date technology that makes the product cumbersome to use. 
              Other possible external factors include key personnel leaving the 
              project or customers changing the requirements specifications. These 
              are all factors that you, as a software developer, cannot control.</span></i><span

              Process (RUP<sup>® </sup>), the Personal Software Process (PSP),

              at a team level; and the PSP provides it at an individual level.

              more explicit support. Instead, the RUP provides a framework for 
              how, what, when, and by whom various activities should take place 
              in order to get a satisfying result. In other words, an organization

              Engineering Institute (SEI) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, developed 
              it in 1995. The PSP provides metrics, process-steps, and templates

              results indicate significant process improvements among software 
              engineers applying the PSP. Factors like productivity, number of 
              injected defects, and time and size estimations tend to improve

                The RUP provides limited support to team members on how to manage 
                work within an iteration. In the RUP, iterations can last for 
                weeks or months. The project manager (or other lead) assigns tasks 
                and responsibilities to project participants. It is up to the 
                individual worker, however, to plan his work during the iteration. 
                The RUP does not provide any support for this. The PSP, in contrast, 
                provides task and schedule planning templates to monitor project 
                progress. With these tools, software engineers can track their 
                progress and know when they are slipping behind schedule. They 
                can then inform the project manager about this status so that 
                appropriate corrective actions can be taken. <br>

                defect data. Rather, they have checklists based on the most typical 
                defect types collected in the organization. As a consequence, 
                software engineers could be looking for defect types they never 
                inject. The PSP, on the other hand, has checklists that are based 
                on personal defect data. So software engineers will be looking 
                for defect types they usually inject.<br>

                The RUP does not provide predefined metrics that software engineers 
                can use to monitor and control their software processes. Before 
                each new project, metrics must be defined and explained to all 
                project participants. There is no guarantee, however, that the 
                defined metrics offer the kind of information a software engineer 
                wants or needs in order to monitor his software development process. 
                In these cases, it is up to the software engineer to define and 
                apply appropriate metrics. The PSP, in contrast, has a number 
                of metrics that provide information on improving the personal 
                software development process. <br>

            <p><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, the PSP material cannot be applied 
              directly by workers using RUP; it must be modified so that it suits 
              the RUP context. If every RUP project were conducted in the same 
              manner -- that is, if all artifacts, activities, workflows, lifecycle 
              models, and so on, never changed -- then the PSP material would 
              only need to be adapted once. This is not the case, however. Every 
              project is unique and needs to be conducted in a particular way 
              in order to be successful. This means that the RUP material -- activities,

              and, furthermore, they were perceived as the main candidates for 
              applying the PSP material. There are other workers in the RUP who 
              also work with PSP activities, but to a lesser degree. For example, 
              the <i>Capsule Designer</i> deals with concurrency issues, and can 
              be viewed as a narrower version of the <i>Designer</i>. As a consequence, 
              the work was restricted to defining PSP Toolboxes for the main worker 
              categories mentioned above. It should be noted, however, that every 
              worker in RUP ought to have a process improvement framework of his 
              own, specially defined for that individual worker's needs and work 
              environment. As the saying goes, however, that is another story;

            <p><span lang=EN-US>Second, the material in the PSP Toolboxes needs 
              to be adapted and adjusted for each individual project. For instance, 
              size metrics should be defined for software development projects, 
              so that team members can measure the size of the products and estimate 
              time and effort. It is impossible to know beforehand, however, whether 
              the worker in question will apply, for example, Lines Of Code (LOC) 
              or Function Points (FP), to name just two size metrics. The choice 
              of metric may depend on the type of application developed or the 
              tool used in the development effort. In addition, it is also impossible 
              to know beforehand if the worker in question will count physical 
              or logical lines if LOC is used, or what kinds of factors and weights 
              he or she will choose if FP is used. As this small example illustrates, 
              for any project, the people actually using the PSP Toolboxes should 
              be the ones who adapt the contents in those toolboxes. <br>

              the PSP and the RUP will be reviewed in the same areas and documented

            <p><span lang=EN-US>The main advantages of supporting the RUP with 
              the PSP are presented in Table 4. Maybe the most important advantage 
              that the PSP provides is the drive for personal excellence. The 
              PSP stresses that personal commitment and excellence are factors 
              that have a major impact on process improvement results. Software 
              engineers should always strive to do the best they can. That way, 
              they will never be disappointed with respect to their efforts. Employees 
              with this kind of commitment always outperform those who do not 
              care about their work results, as long as the paychecks keep coming. 
              The PSP helps people strive for personal excellence. <br>

            <p><span lang=EN-US>It is important to remember that the software 
              development process should provide support for all levels of work: 
              for individuals as well as teams and organizations. The purpose 
              of having defined processes is to ensure that the work ahead can 
              be performed with a reasonably high degree of quality. &quot;A chain 
              is only as strong as its weakest link,&quot; as the saying goes. 
              A project depends on the individuals involved in it, and these individuals, 
              therefore, should have maximum support for improving their work 
              routines. This is where the PSP can enhance the RUP.<br>
