<A NAME="ds-chapter"></A>
<p>
This appendix lists the major data structures that Linux uses and which are described
in this book.
They have been edited slightly to fit the paper.

<p>

<H3>block_dev_struct</H3>
<tt>block_dev_struct</tt> 
data structures are used to register block devices as available for use by 
the buffer cache.
They are held together in the <tt>blk_dev</tt> vector.

<p>

<pre>
struct blk_dev_struct {
    void (*request_fn)(void);
    struct request * current_request;
    struct request   plug;
    struct tq_struct plug_tq;
};
</pre>
<H3>buffer_head</H3>
The <tt>buffer_head</tt> data structure holds information about a block buffer in the 
buffer cache.

<H3>device_struct</H3>
<tt>device_struct</tt> 
data structures are used to register character and block devices (they hold its
name and the set of file operations that can be used for this device).
Each valid member of the <tt>chrdevs</tt> and 
<tt>blkdevs</tt> vectors represents a character or block device 
respectively.

<H3>timer_list</H3>

for processes.

<H3>tq_struct</H3>
Each task queue (<tt>tq_struct</tt>) data structure holds information about work
that has been queued.
This is usually a task needed by a device driver but which does not have to be
done immediately.

a process.
